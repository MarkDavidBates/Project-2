# Project Name: Decibal Detector

Student Name: *Mark Bates*   Student ID: *20088639*

#### Description:

An underwater sensor that records audio levels and temperature, then sends the data to the user
to determine the effects of humans to the marine environment. The Data recorded will be sent to
a Raspberry Pi via Serial and will then be transformed into readable information for the user.

#### Progress:

## To Do:
Connecting the Arduino and RPi via serial is currently not working. My main aim is to get a test
run to work befor moving on to converting the data.

## Completed:
1. Audio and Temperature sensors working simultaniously

#### Tools, Technologies and Equipment:

1. Raspberry Pi 3
2. Arduino
3. Audio sensor
4. Temperature Sensor
4. RGB Display

#### Code Used:

1. Python 3
2. C
