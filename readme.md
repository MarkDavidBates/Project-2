# Project Name: Decibal Detector

Student Name: *Mark Bates*   Student ID: *20088639*

#### Description:

An underwater sensor that records audio levels and temperature, then sends the data to the user
to determine the effects of humans to the marine environment. The Data recorded will be sent to
a Raspberry Pi via Serial and will then be transformed into readable information for the user.

#### Progress:

## To Do:
convert audio and temperature readings into readable dATA

## Completed:
1. Audio and Temperature sensors working simultaniously
2. RPi and Arduino connected via Serial, data showing on linux terminal

#### Tools, Technologies and Equipment:

1. Raspberry Pi 3
2. Arduino
3. Audio sensor
4. Temperature Sensor
4. RGB Display

#### Code Used:

1. Python 3
2. C++
